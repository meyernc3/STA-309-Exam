She's electric
She's in a family full of eccentrics
She's done things I've never expected
And I need more time
She's got a sister
And God only knows how I've missed her
And on the palm of her hand is a blister
And I need more time

And I want you to know
I've got my mind made up now (Mind made up now)
But I need more time
And I want you to say
"Do you know what I'm sayin'?" (What I'm sayin')
But I need more

'Cause I'll be you and you'll be me
There's lots and lots for us to see
Lots and lots for us to do
She is electric, can I be electric too?


She's got a brother (Got a brother)
We don't get on with one another
But I quite fancy her mother
And I think that she likes me
She's got a cousin (Got a cousin)
In fact she's got 'bout a dozen ('Bout a dozen)
She's got one in the oven (In the oven)
But it's nothing to do with me

And I want you to know
I've got my mind made up now (Mind made up now)
But I need more time
And I want you to say
"Do you know what I'm sayin'?" (What I'm sayin')
But I need more

'Cause I'll be you and you'll be me
There's lots and lots for us to see
There's lots and lots for us to do
She is electric, can I be electric too?

Can I be electric too?
Can I be electric too?
Can I be electric too?
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
