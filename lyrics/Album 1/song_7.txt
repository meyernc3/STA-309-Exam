What was that sound
Ringing around your brain?
Today was just a blur
You've got a head like a ghost train
What was that sound
Ringing around your brain?
You're here on your own
Who you gonna find to blame?

You're the outcast
You're the underclass
But you don't care
Because you're living fast
You're the uninvited guest who stays till the end
I know you've got a problem that the Devil sends
You think they're talking 'bout you, but you don't know who
I'll be scraping their lives from the sole of my shoe tonight

Bring it on down
Bring it down for me
Your head's in a fish tank
Your body and your mind can't breathe
Bring it on down
Bring it down for me
Your head's in a fish tank
Your body and your mind can't breathe

You're the outcast
You're the underclass
But you don't care
Because you're living fast
You're the uninvited guest who stays till the end
I know you've got a problem that the Devil sends
You think they're talking 'bout you, but you don't know who
I'll be scraping their lives from the sole of my shoe tonight
