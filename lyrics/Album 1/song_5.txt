I've seen so much to disgust mother
Take me into your arms
How am I to protect you?

There we were, now here we are
All this confusion, nothing's the same to me
There we were, now here we are
All this confusion, nothing's the same to me

I can't tell you the way I feel
Because the way I feel is, oh, so new to me
I can't tell you the way I feel
Because the way I feel is, oh, so new to me

What I heard is not what I hear
I can see the signs, but they're not very clear
What I heard is not what I hear
I can see the signs, but they're not very clear

So I can't tell you the way I feel
Because the way I feel is, oh, so new to me
I can't tell you the way I feel
Because the way I feel is, oh, so new to me
