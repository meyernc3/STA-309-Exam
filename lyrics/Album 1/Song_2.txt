I'd like to be somebody else
And not know where I've been
I'd like to build myself a house
Out of plasticine

Ah-ah, shake along with me
Ah-ah, shake along with me

I've been driving in my car
With my friend Mister Soft
Mister Clean and Mister Benn
Are living in my loft

Ah-ah, shake along with me
Ah-ah, shake along with me


I'm sorry but I just don't know
I know you said I told you so
When you're happy and you're feeling fine
Then you'll know that it's the right time
Then you'll know that it's the right time

To shake along with me
Shake along with me
Shake along with me
Shake along with me


Mister Sifter sold me songs
When I was just sixteen
Now he stops at traffic lights
But only when they're green

Ah-ah, shake along with me
Ah-ah, shake along with me
Ah-ah, shake along with me
Ah-ah


Shake along with me
Shake along with me
Shake along with me
Shake along with me
Shake along with them
Shake along with me
Shake along with them
Shake along with me
