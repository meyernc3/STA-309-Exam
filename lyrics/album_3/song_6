Get off your high horse lady
I don't need a ride tonight
Get off your high horse lady
I don't need a ride tonight
Lay down

I hear your soul song singing
From a fire in the sky
I hear your soul song singing
From a fire in the sky
Rain down
Rain down


Get off your high horse lady
I don't need a ride tonight
Get off your high horse lady
I don't need a ride tonight
Lay down
Lay down
