I still don't know what I was waiting for
A big love to fall down from the sky
She took my hand and picked me up off the floor
She put an apple in my eye

I said I'm tired
Come get me off the merry-go-round
I'm wired
Come feed me and then bring me down

She come up to me, I can't remember what she said
Because I was in a trance and I forgot it all
Banging on about all that, revolution in her head
Sheâ€™d make a lover seem so magical

She said I'm tired
Come get me off the merry-go-round
I'm wired
Well heaven must have sent you
To save me for the rapture, yeah

(Cha, cha, cha, cha
Cha, cha, cha, cha)


I'm tired
Come get me off the merry-go-round
I'm wired
Come feed me and then bring me down
