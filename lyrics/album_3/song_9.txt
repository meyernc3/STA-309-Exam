They got nothing on me anymore
They got nothing on you
I don't care what they say anymore
All I want is the truth

Out on bail to unveil
Here's a song, sing along

They got nothing for me anymore
I got nothing for you
I don't care what they say anymore
All I want is the truth

Out on bail to unveil
Here's a song, sing along
Watch my style, pick a place
Wipe the smile from your face
Out on bail to unveil
Here's a song, sing along
Watch my style, pick a place
Wipe the smile from your face



They got nothing on me anymore
They got nothing on you
I don't care what they say anymore
All I want is the truth
