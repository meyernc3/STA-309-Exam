(One, two, three, four)

The summer sun, it blows my mind
It's falling down on all that I've ever known
Time will kiss the world goodbye
Falling down on all that I've ever known
It is all that I've ever known

A dying scream, makes no sound
Calling out to all that I've ever known
Here am I, lost and found
Calling out to all

We live a dying dream
If you know what I mean
All that I've ever known
It's all that I've ever known


Catch the wheel that breaks the butterfly
I cried the rain that fills the ocean wide
I tried to talk with God to no avail
I call him up in and out of nowhere
I said, "If you won't save me, please, don't waste my time"


(Hoo-ooh, hoo-ooh
Falling down on all
Hoo-ooh, falling down on all
That I've ever known
It's all that I've ever known)


Catch the wheel that breaks the butterfly
I cried the rain that fills the ocean wide
I tried to talk with God to no avail
I called him up in and out of nowhere
Said, "If you won't save me, please, don't waste my time"

(Hoo-ooh)

The summer sun, blows my mind
It's falling down on all that I've ever known
Time will kiss the world goodbye
Falling down on all that I've ever known
It is all that I've ever known
