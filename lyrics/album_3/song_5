La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la-ah
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la-ah

Here's a song
It reminds me of when we were young
Looking back at all the things we've done
You gotta keep on keeping on
Out to sea
It's the only place I honestly
Can get myself some peace of mind
You know it's getting hard to fly

If I'm to fall
Would you be there to applaud?
Or would you hide behind them all?
'Cause if I have to go
In my heart you grow
And that's where you belong



If I'm to fall
Would you be there to applaud?
Or would you hide behind them all?
'Cause if I have to go
In my heart you grow
And that's where you belong
If I'm to fall
Would you be there to applaud?
Or would you hide behind them all?
'Cause if I have to go
In my heart you grow
And that's where you belong
(La, la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la)

Guess I'm out of time
I'm out of time
I'm out of time
I'm out of time
I'm out of time

(As Churchill said, it's the Englishman's inalienable right to live where the hell he likes
I said, what do you think, it's gonna vanish?
It's not going to be there when I get back?)
