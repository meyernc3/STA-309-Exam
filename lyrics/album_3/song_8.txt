Days, turning to night
Pray for a light
Let me come through, let me take you
Way over the line

Everyone fallin', everyone fallin'
Jailers come crawling, neighbours jump walling
Let me come through, let me take you
Way over the line, over the line
Over the line, over the line

And we'll wake to be where there's life
Shake the will to comply
Fears don't try me, tears don't cry me
And we'll wake to be where there's life

When we come call out, everything's sold out
T.V. just closed down, there's nothing on the news now
Fears don't try me, tears don't cry me
And we'll wake to be where there's life, be where there's life
Be where there's life, be where there's life


Dig out your soul, 'cause here we go
We gotta move, it's what we do
Let me come through, let me take you
And we'll wake to be where there's life, be where there's life
Be where there's life

Take you over the light, under the signs
In through locked doors to secret floors
Where we've all stood before
