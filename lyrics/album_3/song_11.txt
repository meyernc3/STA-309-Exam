Hold the line, friend of mine
Sing a song, soldier on
Shine a light for me tonight
Don't be long, soldier on

La, la-ah
La, la-ah
La, la-ah
La, la-ah

Who's to say that you were right
And I was wrong, soldier on
Come the day, come the night
I'll be gone, soldier on

La, la-ah
La, la-ah
La, la-ah
La, la-ah

Soldier on, soldier on
Soldier on, soldier on
Soldier on, soldier on
Soldier on, soldier on
Soldier on, soldier on
Soldier on, soldier on


Soldier on, soldier on
Soldier on, soldier on
Soldier on, soldier on
Soldier on, soldier on
Soldier on, soldier on
Soldier on, soldier on
Soldier on, soldier on
Soldier on, soldier on
